My first game released in Steam. Temporarily made public for interviews.   
[Steam Link](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1303440/Noise_Hunters/) - Mostly Positive with 50k downloads!

## Highlights
- Sole Game Programmer. AI, Gameplay, Systems, Tools... all made by me! :)
- Co-designed Enemy AI and Combat Gameplay
- Created a Sound Wave library system to display all the types of sounds (Normal Waves, Nullyfing Waves, Detection Waves...)
- Handled Finite State Machine AI with modular sensors through Unity's Animator. It was an odd choice to use it for AI, but it worked! 
- Programmed a flexible Mission Manager, with generic "objectives" such as Kill Objectives, Use Objectives, Collect Objectives... which also show up in the compass
- Tweaked some parts of Unity's UI and EventSystem library to allow better UI handling with either Keyboard, Mouse or Controller
- Translations handled through a csv file, parsed to a dictionary
- Steam integration with Achievements
- And much more!
